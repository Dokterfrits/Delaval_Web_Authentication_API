# Delaval_v300_Web_Authentication
A python program to authenticate at the webui of the Delaval v300 automatic milking station AMS and establish a websocket connection to interact with the machine.
=======
# WebSocket Automation for Delaval AMS control

## Overview

This project automates authentication and WebSocket communication with multiple AMS machines. It logs in using hashed credentials, establishes WebSocket connections, and can send control messages to specific machines.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dokterfrits/Delaval_v300_Web_Authentication
   cd websocket-automation
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Rename **config_template.json** to **config.json** and update the credentials and urls in the project directory:
   ```json
   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password",
       "urls": [
          "wss://amssc.vms.delaval.com:8443/ws", // Login server, don't change this. Used to retrieve user uuid with token
          "wss://192.168.168.1/ws", // Your AMS on network. Variations on "wss://vms_1.vms.delaval.com/ws" might also work
          "wss://192.168.168.2/ws" // Second machine, add more lines if necessary
       ]
   }
   ```

## Usage

Run the script:

```sh
python main.py
```

## Features

- Secure authentication with hashed credentials
- WebSocket connection to multiple machines
- Sends control messages dynamically to a selected machine
- Logs responses and identifies which machine sent them

## Troubleshooting

- If authentication fails, check the credentials in `config.json`.
- If SSL errors occur, try setting `verify=False` in requests.
- If no messages are received, ensure WebSocket URLs are correct.
